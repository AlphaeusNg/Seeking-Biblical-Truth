One of the two spies that trusted in God's ability to lead the nation of Israel into the promised Land. [[Num 14]]
Was the leader that took over from Moses to lead them. ([[Deu 31_1-8]], [[Deu 34_9]])

**Meaning of the word**
'Joshua') in later books of the Hebrew Bible and among Jews of the Second Temple period. The name corresponds to the Greek spelling Iesous (Ἰησοῦς), from which, through the Latin IESVS/Iesus, comes the English spelling Jesus.

_Yeshua_ is the Hebrew name, and its English spelling is “Joshua.” _Iesous_ is the Greek transliteration of the Hebrew name, and its English spelling is “Jesus.” Thus, the names “Joshua” and “Jesus” are essentially the same; both are English pronunciations of the Hebrew and Greek names for our Lord. (For examples of how the two names are interchangeable, see [Acts 7:45](https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/7/Acts-7-45.html) and [Hebrews 4:8](https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/4/Hebrews-4-8.html) in the KJV. In both cases, the word _Jesus_ refers to the Old Testament character Joshua.)

**Significance**
Joshua led Israel to promised land -> Jesus leads the world to heaven.
