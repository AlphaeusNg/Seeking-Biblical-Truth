Assignment 7-1: In three or four typed pages, describe your family background in regard to cultural influences. Discuss as well as you can both your mother (and her family) and your father (and his family). Include any other families who may have influenced you as well. For each, discuss attitudes and views toward religion, family, work, education, and wealth. Describe the socioeconomic location of your family and its religious context. Also, how do members of your family tend to relate to each other? Does your family tend to be warm and “huggy” or cold and distant? Finally, try to relate your family background to your own set of values and outlooks. What have you retained? What have you rejected?

*Note: This assignment is not meant to pry into your personal life. Feel free to omit anything in the written assignment about which you are sensitive. But be sure to think about those things you omit so that you are aware of their influence on your study of the Bible. This exercise is a self-analysis; it is for your benefit and not outs.*

**Family Background and Cultural Influences**

I was born into a Singaporean family with both parents being ethnically Chinese (FYI, Singaporean Chinese have a distinct identity separate from mainland Chinese, which means our loyalty lies with Singapore, and not China! Just a fun fact). The typical Singaporean Chinese family embodies a meritocratic mindset, where hard work is essential for survival. This societal culture is reflected in the achievements of our local students, who frequently excel in global competitions in mathematics, science, and more. Many of our behaviors and values stem from this spirit of perseverance and dedication. By and large, the typical Singaporean parent prioritizes securing the best education for their child. If having religious friends broadens their horizons and helps them become well-rounded, that’s seen as positive. However, if religious commitments, like attending services on Sunday, take time away from studying, that’s viewed negatively. This mindset is pervasive even within church communities, where some parents allow their children to skip church if they have a big exam coming up.

Singaporean culture is quite sensitive when it comes to religion, and people often avoid asking religious questions for fear of potentially offending others. With four main religions—Islam, Buddhism, Christianity, and Hinduism—coexisting in our society, there's an unspoken rule to tread carefully around matters of faith.

My father’s family consisted of his three younger brothers and a younger sister. They were raised in a Buddhist household, but my dad became a Christian during his teenage years. As a result, his siblings were exposed to Christian practices and became somewhat knowledgeable about them. Occasionally, they would show curiosity and ask questions, but these conversations were usually brief and cautious, reflecting the general sensitivity around religious topics. From my perspective as a young child, nothing substantial came from these exchanges.

On my mother’s side, she also came from a middle-income family. Her siblings have all done well financially, and some converted to Christianity, though not from the church of Christ heritage. However, religion wasn’t a central part of their identity, so it didn’t dominate conversations. Discussions typically focused on secular achievements and milestones. Occasionally, “Christian matters” would surface, especially when societal norms clashed with our Christian beliefs—like in discussions about drinking alcohol, offering joss sticks to the deceased, or attending family gatherings on Sundays. But for the most part, these conversations were rare and handled with cautious grace.

Growing up, my immediate family was in what you might call an "upper-poor" income bracket. We had a home and a roof over our heads, though simple. We had food, clothes, and entertainment, but just the bare minimum, often from gifts from friends and family. There were many reasons for this, but the largest was due to the cancer that took my mother’s life when I was four. The treatment was long and extremely costly, and I’m sure it took a large toll on my dad’s health and time as he cared for her while providing for the family. Nevertheless, my father’s and mother’s siblings were always supportive, often giving us small gifts of money and helping to look after us.

Unlike many Chinese families in Singapore, we primarily spoke English at home. This was largely due to my father's upbringing and his deep involvement in the church, which was an English-speaking community. His Chinese wasn’t great, and this shaped the language environment in our household, which then trickled down to us. So while I’m Chinese, I am quite different from the kind of “Chinese” most people would think of.

**Religious Context and Family Values**

Both of my parents were Christians, having converted from a predominantly Buddhist society. They faced a lot of pressure and rejection from their own parents—some were even locked out of their house for attending church on Sundays. Naturally, those who remained faithful in Christ became “battle-hardened” warriors who had fought tirelessly for their faith and, through God’s providence, emerged victorious. My parents were no exception. This tenacity forged the spirit by which they served Christ and their own family. I remember many anecdotes of how their parents would cut up all their clothes so that they had nothing to wear for church, leading them to wear their school uniforms instead. Or how their parents would threaten them, saying that if they continued to follow Jesus, they would no longer be their sons or daughters. But by God’s grace, and after 20 to 30 years of persistent faith and effort, most of them saw the change in their lives and eventually decided to follow Jesus.

My father studied at Four Seas Bible College in Singapore and was trained to be a preacher. He was sent to start a congregation in Punggol, a region located in the northeastern part of Singapore. The congregation grew to about 20+ people, but due to a falling out with an American missionary, the church eventually dwindled to solely my family. Despite this, my father remained committed to the mission, continuing to serve faithfully in his ministry to this day. This was the kind of man I lived under and the kind of values that were instilled in our family by example. My mother retired from her job as an accountant to focus on the household. Part of that was practical, with four kids to care for, but it was also to ensure our home was rooted in Christian principles.

Our family’s religious life was central to our daily routines. We attended church every Sunday, and my father would often sing Bible songs to me when I was little, like "Jesus loves me, this I know, for the Bible tells me so." These songs and the faith they expressed laid the foundation for my own spiritual journey and understanding of God. Many people say that the paternal role model in your life shapes your understanding of God the Father, and that rings true for me. Seeing the love my dad poured out for me helped me see God in a favorable light. I came to understand that God was just like my father, but greater! So that helped to build an early trust and a healthy respect for “Father figures.”

**Family Dynamics and Socioeconomic Context**

Despite our modest financial situation, my father worked tirelessly to provide for us. He was the preacher for our small church, which consisted solely of our family. This meant there was no salary given to him. After delivering the Sunday sermon and sending us home, he would return to work as a taxi driver to earn whatever he could before coming back at 10-11 pm. In spite of all the tiring hours he worked, he always made time for us. In rotation, he would take one of us out for a movie every Friday to spend quality time together. Though I was embarrassed whenever he tried to haggle with the ticketing staff for a better deal (because it showed our poorness, of which a child is embarrassed as it’s his identity), when I look back now, I’m so thankful for the love that he outpoured for us. I see clearly that it was through God’s sustenance that my father was able to raise four children in the Lord on his own after my mother passed away.

Regarding my siblings, I have three older sisters who naturally stepped up to fill the void of maternal care for me. From a young age, they showed great love and care for me, fetching me to and from school, entertaining me, and teaching me school subjects.

The relational dynamics in our family were moderate, which is pretty typical in Asian culture. We weren’t overly affectionate in a physical sense, like hugging, which was reserved for the biggest of milestones. But we expressed care and affection more subtly—daily check-ins, asking if someone had eaten, or offering to buy food. This was how we showed love and concern.

**Influence of the Wider Church Community**

The other church I attended, Lavender church of Christ, played a significant role in my upbringing, acting as an extended spiritual family. They taught me our heritage’s doctrinal understanding of the Bible, supported me financially for church camps, and sometimes took me out for meals. This communal support was invaluable, providing many additional perspectives that were necessary for healthy spiritual growth. While my dad was an amazing role model, God used a church filled with countless members with varying gifts to raise me up holistically—in service, through friends, older sisters and brothers in the faith, and other uncles and aunties who I could turn to when I couldn’t go to my dad. They gave me a sense of identity and companions that eventually served as an encouragement for me in my faith.

**Personal Growth and Faith Journey**

As I grew older, my faith was allowed to develop organically and was never forced upon me. When I was sixteen, I decided to stop going to church, finding it more interesting to stay home and watch YouTube videos. My dad didn’t force me to attend church but gently encouraged me every Sunday. By God’s grace, I eventually returned to the church of my own volition, and a faith that was truly my own—not merely my parents'—began to grow. This experience deepened my awe of God as the Shepherd who leads His children to Him, and it shaped my understanding of how faith should be nurtured.

This approach to upbringing was quite different from that of many parents in the local churches of Christ, who often forced their children to attend church, leading to a faith that wasn’t rooted in personal encounters with Jesus. My journey taught me that true faith flourishes when it’s chosen freely, out of a personal relationship with God.

**Personal Reflections and Values**

Looking back on my upbringing, I’ve retained many of the Christian worldviews my father lived out. I’ve retained that Jesus is my Lord as much as it’s his. I’ve retained the awareness of the awe-powerful God we serve, the Creator of all things - time, space, and matter. I’ve retained the understanding that I deserved death because of sin, yet thanks be to Jesus Christ who has saved us while I was yet a sinner. Everything I do, it’s all for the sake of Christ. A life transformed by Him. 

However, there are aspects of my upbringing that I have come to reconsider—not so much the values my father instilled, but rather the legalistic tendencies in some segments of the churches of Christ in Singapore, particularly the [[sectarian]] approach to theology. The prevailing mindset often suggests that unless one adheres perfectly to every doctrinal point, they do not belong to the "true" church and are therefore not saved.

While it is essential to establish doctrine rationally and soundly through faithful obedience to Scripture, I believe that grace must accompany our understanding of what is biblically sound. The heart of following Jesus Christ is not merely about doctrinal precision—“dotting the t’s and missing the i’s”—but about a life radically transformed by the Holy Spirit through the Word. As Jesus taught, "You will know them by their fruits." God's ultimate desire is for “mercy, not sacrifice”—a statement that reveals His preference for genuine love and compassion over rigid ritualism.

In the pursuit of doctrinal correctness, there is a risk of losing sight of the bigger picture—missing the tree for the forest. Legalism can cloud the transformative power of the gospel, reducing faith to a checklist rather than a dynamic relationship with God. Our true calling is to live out a faith that reflects the mercy, grace, and love of Christ, which are the real markers of a life aligned with God's will.
