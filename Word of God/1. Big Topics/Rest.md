Faithful leaders, pg 75 
- "When he commanded his people to work six days and rest for one, he did not make an exemption for you because you're so important to his mission that he can't manage it without the extra seventh of your time."
- "Your day off is your statement that you truly believe that the Lord is sovereign."
- "There will always be more good things you could do, and so by taking a day off you will always be choosing not to do good things. But you have to leave the work with him anyways (It was always his work). Unless He builds the house, you labour in vain" ([[Psa 127]])
