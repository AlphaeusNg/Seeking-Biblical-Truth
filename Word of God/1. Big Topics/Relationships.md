Relationships are one of the most important means the Bible puts forth to calling people out of sin. Just as a few examples, we’re called to admonish and instruct one another ([[Romans 15_14]]), bear each other’s burdens ([[Galatians 6_2]]), confess our sins to each other ([[James 5_16]]), and motivate one another ([[Hebrews 10_24]]).

One of the best verses describing the role of an ally is [[2 Timothy 2_22]], which says, “Flee from youthful passions, and pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace, along with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart.” Notice that Paul is telling Timothy to do three things:

1. **Run from** youthful passions;
2. **Run toward** good things; and
3. **Run with** others.

This means your role is three-fold.
