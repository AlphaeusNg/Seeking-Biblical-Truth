The essentiality of Baptism required for [[Salvation]] hinges on the interpretation of these verses:
- For -> [[Acts 2_38]], [[Acts 22_16]], [[Mark 16_16]], [[1 Peter 3_20-21]], [[John 3_5]], [[Gal 3_27]]
- "Against" -> [[John 3_16]], [[Acts 16_31]], [[Eph 2_8-9]]
	- Not necessarily contradicts Baptism, but more of the idea that [[Believes]] or [[Faith]] in Christ is the axiom for salvation, and Baptism fits into that framework via being an "outward sign of an inward faith" [[Rom 4]] of the parallel to Abraham's justification. Therefore salvation occurs at belief rather than baptism.
