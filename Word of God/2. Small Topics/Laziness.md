MN502 Biblical Preaching Assignment 

I really enjoyed the various dimensions Steve brings about regarding the Calling of a Preacher.

1. First and foremost, the preacher **owes it to those supporting him**. Even from a worldly perspective, it's a rudimentary principle that's reasonable to see. The preacher does a good work for the Lord, in labouring for the growth of the body, and the body, in turn, supplies what is within their means for the benefit of the preacher. This relationship is good and glorifies God. Yet, if the preacher grows lazy, he tarnishes the godly relationship established between him and the church, and he betrays the sacrifice the body makes for him. Folly and ingratitude is returned for sacrificial love!  
    1 Tim 5:18 says,
    
    > For the Scripture says, “You shall not muzzle an ox when it treads out the grain,” and, “The laborer deserves his wages."
    
    A worker is worth his wages **if** he "treads out the grain"! So at the minimum, be worthy of your wages!  
    
2. The idea of **being a hindrance** was very apt as well. In our mission for Christ, laziness will be an obvious stumbling block unto others. Even the perception of laziness, whether true or not, gives Satan an easy opportunity to tempt others to sin. Having thoughts like "Oh, he didn't join this event because..." and then Satan swoops in for the kill, "...because he's hard at work elsewhere distracted with idle things!" Furthermore, as Steve pointed out, if we don't "walk the talk," our message loses power, opening the door to contempt for God.  
      
3. **Failure to adequately prepare lessons** is a point that hits closer to my heart. I often struggle to discipline myself to sit down, open up my Google doc, and meditate on the Word. Steve's question, "Do we enter the pulpit because we have to say something, or because we have something to say?" accurately illuminates the spirit with which I've served the body. May God mold and strengthen me in this area in time, all glory be to Him!  
    
4. Recently in my ministry, I've begun seeing with clarity the importance of one-on-one meetups and have begun meeting up more often with the young men and young guys in my church. And so, the **failure to get involved with others** is a tragedy God has opened my eyes to. A big problem with not meeting outside of Sundays is that genuine relationships will not have a platform to grow and mature. These interactions are where bridges are built, problems are shared, sins are confessed, and growth in Jesus our Lord happens. Therefore, a preacher who fails to do this out of laziness is severely letting the congregation down.  
    
5. And perhaps the most fundamental point is this - **fall more deeply in love with Jesus**. Steve hit it right where "We do not consider the difficult work we do for those we love". If preachers are born again (John 3), it's no longer them who live, but Christ who lives in them (Gal 2:20). The deeper we love Jesus, the deeper we will love the congregation, and the deeper all the other points will be addressed. 2 Cor 5:14-15 says:
    
    > 14 For Christ’s love compels us, because we are convinced that one died for all, and therefore all died. 15 And he died for all, that those who live should no longer live for themselves but for him who died for them and was raised again.
    
    and so, if we're truly convinced that Jesus has died for us, the love of Christ will **compel** us to live for Jesus who has defeated death on our behalf! Which means putting to death laziness! For that leads to death.
