21 Therefore, if anyone cleanses himself from what is dishonorable,[d] he will be a vessel for honorable use, set apart as holy, useful to the master of the house, ready for every good work.

==22 So flee youthful passions and pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace, along with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart.== 23 Have nothing to do with foolish, ignorant controversies; you know that they breed quarrels.

Notice that Paul is telling Timothy to do three things:

1. **Run from** youthful passions;
    
2. **Run toward** good things; and
    
3. **Run with** others.
