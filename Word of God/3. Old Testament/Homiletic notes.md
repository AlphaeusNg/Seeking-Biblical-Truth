1. Narrative makes up nearly half of the OT!
    - Derives primarily from the actions of the character (including God!).
    - Shows us how to live or not to live.
    - That OT narratives are concerned with these three interrelated things: History, theology, and aesthetics! As mentioned in the book.
2. **Advantages of narrative**
    - Interesting to both children and adults -> Easy to remember.
    - Pulls us into the action of the story -> God teaches us something about Himself in the narrative.
    - Depicts real life and it's easy to relate to -> A holistic POV as we see real struggles and resolutions that we will face
    - Portrays the ambiguities and complexities of life -> Helps us to see how the smaller stories all connect to a big picture (which is exactly what we're going through in our lives today!)
3. **Disadvantages of narratives**
    - Meaning might not be clearly stated.
    - The reader is enthralled by the story and misses meaning.
    - Assume narrative only deals with history, not theology.
    - Read too much theology into narratives.
4. The basic features of plot
    - Exposition: description of the setting
    - Conflict: Can be internal or external
    - Resolution: How the conflict is resolved
    - E.g.
        - Ruth and bethany (house of bread when there's no bread, irony.)
        - The ambiguity whether uriah knew about what King David did. May be the author trying to show us what David himself felt, the ambiguity.
5. Make sure you understand how your episode fits into the book. Min study 3 chapters, before n after.  
6. "Good guys and white hats". Most characters contain a mixture of good n bad traits, don't project this perfection unto them. They're meant to be real people!  
7. God's the main character! Let God be God! Don't bring in theological preconceptions into OT narratives.
