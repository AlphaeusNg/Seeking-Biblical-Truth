1. Rehab vs Achan.
    - The story of the conquest of Jericho paints a bigger picture! Why was so much time poured into Rahab at the start? And the story of Achan at the end?
        - Chapter 1: Israel begins its conquest of the Promised Land
        - Chapter 2: The story of Rahab the harlot and her faith
        - Chapter 3-5: Israel prepares to attack Jericho (Rahab's city)
        - Chapter 6: The capture and destruction of Jericho
        - Chapter 7: The story of Achan and his disobedience
    - The crazy parallels between those two:
        - Canaanite woman vs Hebrew man (tribe of Judah)
        - Prostitute vs Respectable
        - Should have died, but survived vs Should have prospered, but died
        - Her family survives vs His family perishes
        - Her nation perishes <> Nation prospers
        - Hides the spies from the King <> Hides loot from God and Joshua
        - Fears the God of Israel <> Does not fear God of Israel
        - Has only heard of God, yet believes <> Has seen the acts of God, disobeys
        - Her house survives, but city burned <> His tent is burned
        - Cattle, sheep, donkeys in Jericho perish <> His cattle, sheep, donkeys perish
        - Becomes like an Israelite and lives <> Becomes like a Cannanite and dies
    - Canaanite becomes an Israelite, the Israelite becomes Canaanites!Â 
    - Two diff ppl because of their faith in God, change places!
