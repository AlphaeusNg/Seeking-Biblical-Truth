# Ideas
## Christian discussion App
Main goal that everyone should have being on the app - **An open search for the closest biblical truth.**
### Features:
- Robust truth weight metric assigned to each statement. Probably determined by community. Perhaps similar to community notes on X.
- Easy UI/UX for layman/scholars to contribute/refute ongoing discussions.
- Accurate summary of long chain of discussion and thoughts.
- everything should be easily linked to everything.
- Should be a visualisation as seen in Obsidian visualisation
  - Think of how to categorise ideas. Obsidian has a limitation where it doesn't allow an idea to subsume a sub-idea. E.g. If I have a node titled 'Ephesians', but I also want to visualise Eph 1:2, it won't appear as two distinct nodes. I want it so that when i click on the 'Ephesians' node, it'll expand and show all the smaller Ephesian nodes in it.

# Spiritual-to-do
1. Firm up on the COC doctrinal stance and explore deeply our positions on it.

		1. "If we do just what our Lord commanded we know that our salvation is certain." -> Not wrong in the sense where if we picture a child doing with superficial understanding what the Father wants, the Father will not hold it against the child. But to understand the spirit by which the commandment is given, the Father sees and is equally (if not more?) delighted at the pursuit of the heart.
