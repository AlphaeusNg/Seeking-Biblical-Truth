Perhaps the ultimate principle for the maturest Christian:
1. Follow Jesus Christ as our Lord and Saviour who has saved us from sin.
2. Rooted in God's words (to your level of understanding and each ought to be convicted in his position and able to reason through biblical truths/principles while maintaining grace in fringe doctrinal stances)
	1. Allows unity to be achieved in a way that's compatible with the vibrancy of culture and expression of God's people yet with biblical truth of God's character
