"O wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from death? Thanks be to God for his grace through Jesus Christ our Lord. For greater love hath no man than this, that while I was a sinner, Christ gave His life for mine." [[Rom 7_24-25]], [[John 15:13]], [[Rom 5_8]]

Perhaps the ultimate principle for the maturest Christian:
1. Follow Jesus Christ as our Lord and Saviour who has saved us from sin.
2. Rooted in God's words (to your level of understanding and each ought to be convicted in his position and able to reason through biblical truths/principles while maintaining grace in fringe doctrinal stances)
	1. Allows unity to be achieved in a way that's compatible with the vibrancy of culture and expression of God's people yet with biblical truth of God's character

My worldview:
1. Aim at the highest possible truth that you can conceive of and keep modifying it so your aim gets better.

Thoughts:
1. Make the presumption that other people have the same presumptive values as you do.
	1. The universal value that everyone is made in the image of God -> pursuit of truth
2. What makes reality real? Death is the one thing that is very real, and makes reality real. So if you eliminate death, you fundamentally eliminate the one thing that keeps reality real.
	1. In reference to downloading our consciousness into an immortal digital manifestation. Which may undermine reality's reality.
3. The more fundamental the [[axiom]] is to you, the more chaotic potential it has in it's shifting, but also the more order it may result in.
	1. Which is why there's so much negative emotion associated with it, and also an incredible amount of positivity at the end of it.
	2. The 3 mythological fundamentals that describes the origin of... life?
4. Vengeance is mine saith the Lord, is an **incredibly** profound fundamental [[axiom]] of life.
	1. Leads to forgiveness, leads people to living their life in a way that's congruent with reality?
